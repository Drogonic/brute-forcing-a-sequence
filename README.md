# brute-forcing-a-sequence
The goal of this program is to brute force create a matching sequence given only the range of possible coefficents and a given sequence to match. 
Uses:
Recurssion to generate the numbers in the sequence
Nested for loops to cycle through the coefficents
Methods to handle checking the sequence against the given
